Project: terminal-first local dashboard for AI coding-agent / IDE / LLM API usage, spend, quotas, and rate limits. Auto-detects tools and keys. Public repo: https://github.com/nurulislamz/agentusage

## Competitors

### Seeded 2026-09-04 (v2)

**Primary peer risk:** [OpenUsage.sh](https://openusage.sh) markets nearly the same thesis (local terminal multi-tool quotas/spend/auto-detect). Differentiate on coverage, UX, or packaging — or collide.

| Product | Layer | What they do | Vs agentUsage |
|---|---|---|---|
| [OpenUsage.sh](https://openusage.sh) ([GitHub](https://github.com/janekbaraniewski/openusage)) | Local multi-tool TUI | Auto-detect agents/keys, quotas, spend, rate limits, burn rate, statusline; 35+ tools. | **Nearest twin.** Treat as #1 peer. |
| [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) | Local CLI reports | Daily/weekly/monthly/session/blocks from agent logs (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Goose, Copilot CLI, Gemini, …). | Strong OSS peer on history/reports; thinner live quota dashboard. |
| ccusage UI dashboards / claude-monitor | Local UI/TUI | HTML or live burn-rate for Claude Code. | Claude-centric niche. |
| Cursor Spending tab + Admin API | Vendor | Plan pools, spend limits; Enterprise team spend APIs. | Cursor only. |
| [Cursor Spend Tracker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=helper2424.cursor-spend-tracker) | Extension | Status-bar spend via Admin API. | Cursor team only. |
| [cursor-usage-tracker](https://github.com/ofershap/cursor-usage-tracker) | Self-host team | Cursor Enterprise spend + anomaly Slack alerts. | FinOps for Cursor orgs, not local multi-provider autodetection. |
| Claude Code `/usage` `/cost`, claude.ai Usage | Vendor | Session/plan bars, 5h blocks. | Anthropic only. |
| OpenRouter Activity | Vendor / gateway | Credits and model cost analytics. | Hosted gateway billing. |
| [Helicone](https://www.helicone.ai), [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) | Cloud/proxy observability | Traces, sessions, cost for instrumented apps. | Wrong layer for raw CLI agent logs; complementary if exporting OTel later. |
| [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai) proxy spend | Gateway | Virtual keys, budgets, admin UI. | Org gateway control, not personal agent detector. |
| Vantage Cursor reports / Lineman.io | FinOps / team SaaS | Cloud spend or Claude team visibility. | Enterprise; not terminal-first local. |

**Positioning**
- Narrative: **one pane for every agent on the machine**.
- Beat ccusage on live quotas/rate-limit probing + dashboard UX.
- Explicitly differentiate from OpenUsage.sh (providers, UX, install path) — same category.
